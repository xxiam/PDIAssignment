Nova Scotia,Glooscap First Nation,30,Solid waste management,Solid Waste Reduction and Management Plan,Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq has initiated this second phase to help their communities to reduce waste costs environmental impact and enhance community capacities. This project will be broken down into five initiatives: (1) They will help each community develop a waste management advisory committee. (2) They will work with each community to develop community specific community engagement awareness and capacity building sessions/initiatives. (3) They will help each community to review their municipal-type service agreements and develop bylaws and policies. (4) They will develop three pilot composting facilities: one each in Millbrook Sipekne'katik and Paqtnkek. (5) They will help each community develop non-traditional waste disposal and collection. Composting component - issues relating to waste diversion are leading to high tipping fees and are acting as a barrier to effective waste management. This is leading to higher operations and maintenance fees more illegal dumping/disposal more mass going to landfills and ultimately a larger environmental impact. By implementing a community composting program some of these issues would be addressed effectively. Additional cost of $27500.00.,Completed,45.04177449,-64.23501963,GCS_North_American_1983_CSRS

This project will be broken down into five initiatives: (1) They will help each community develop a waste management advisory committee. (2) They will work with each community to develop community specific community engagement awareness and capacity building sessions/initiatives. (3) They will help each community to review their municipal-type service agreements and develop bylaws and policies. (4) They will develop three pilot composting facilities: one each in Millbrook Sipekne'katik and Paqtnkek. (5) They will help each community develop non-traditional waste disposal and collection. Composting component - issues relating to waste diversion are leading to high tipping fees and are acting as a barrier to effective waste management. This is leading to higher operations and maintenance fees more illegal dumping/disposal more mass going to landfills and ultimately a larger environmental impact. By implementing a community composting program some of these issues would be addressed effectively. Additional cost of $27500.00.,Completed,45.06660756,-64.65166566,GCS_North_American_1983_CSRS

Nova Scotia,Pictou Landing First Nation,24,Solid waste management,Solid Waste Reduction and Management Plan,Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq has initiated this second phase to help their communities to reduce waste costs environmental impact and enhance community capacities. This project will be broken down into five initiatives: (1) They will help each community develop a waste management advisory committee. (2) They will work with each community to develop community specific community engagement awareness and capacity building sessions/initiatives. (3) They will help each community to review their municipal-type service agreements and develop bylaws and policies. (4) They will develop three pilot composting facilities: one each in Millbrook Sipekne'katik and Paqtnkek. (5) They will help each community develop non-traditional waste disposal and collection. Composting component - issues relating to waste diversion are leading to high tipping fees and are acting as a barrier to effective waste management. This is leading to higher operations and maintenance fees more illegal dumping/disposal more mass going to landfills and ultimately a larger environmental impact. By implementing a community composting program some of these issues would be addressed effectively. Additional cost of $27500.00.,Completed,45.67587418,-62.65256398,GCS_North_American_1983_CSRS

Nova Scotia,Paqtnkek Mi'kmaw Nation,19,Solid waste management,Solid Waste Reduction and Management Plan,Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq has initiated this second phase to help their communities to reduce waste costs environmental impact and enhance community capacities. This project will be broken down into five initiatives: (1) They will help each community develop a waste management advisory committee. (2) They will work with each community to develop community specific community engagement awareness and capacity building sessions/initiatives. (3) They will help each community to review their municipal-type service agreements and develop bylaws and policies. (4) They will develop three pilot composting facilities: one each in Millbrook Sipekne'katik and Paqtnkek. (5) They will help each community develop non-traditional waste disposal and collection. Composting component - issues relating to waste diversion are leading to high tipping fees and are acting as a barrier to effective waste management. This is leading to higher operations and maintenance fees more illegal dumping/disposal more mass going to landfills and ultimately a larger environmental impact. By implementing a community composting program some of these issues would be addressed effectively. Additional cost of $27500.00.,Completed,45.60157993,-61.73829752,GCS_North_American_1983_CSRS
